# Career Opportunity Alert
Career Opportunity platform aims to maximize job placements by effectively matching students with potential employers. 
The platform partners with over 750 university career centers worldwide to help connect students with job opportunities. 
Its business model selects up to 20 candidates for each job offer. Students can express their interest, and companies then choose from those interested candidates.

## Objective
The objective is to analyze Career Opportunity platform data and study the studetns behaviour, to make dashboard that provides insights into product performance, 
equipped with decision making tools to help identify potential improvement and product enhancement.

## Dataset
for permission puposes, the original name for the platform to Career Opportunity. The dataset was provided by our mentors, including the data from year July 2019 to September 2020.

## Data Cleaning
We performed multiple steps including:
* Handle null values.
* Rename and delete columns.
* Handle data types.
* Separate date columns.

## Analyze 
After cleaning the data, we started searching for trends and insights. Using the KPIs suitable for this objective led us to draw conclusions that matched the hypotheses we assumed.
The KPIs we chose were:
* OPT-IN rate: The percentage of students who actively opt-in for opportunities.
* Declined Rate: The percentage of declined students for a job.
* Engagement Rate: The percentage of students who engage with the platform.
* Approved Rate: The percentage of students approved for a job
* Response Rate: The percentage of students who respond to Shortlist offers.

## Results and Recommendation 
After analyzing the data, we concluded that most of the students who applied are from France. Engagement with the platform peaks in October and November, 
while it drops during other months of the year. Companies decline students even when their information is complete, 
which could indicate that job placement is not efficient. The majority of students prefer to apply through their colleges' or schools' career centers 
rather than the platform. We recommend making changes to the platform to make it more user-friendly for students, 
providing detailed job information and offering more support to recruiters.
